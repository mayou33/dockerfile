## Maintained by: [the Docker Community](https://github.com/docker-library/mongo)

This is the Git repo of the [Docker "Official Image"](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_repos/) for [mongo](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/) (not to be confused with any official mongo image provided by mongo upstream). See [the Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/) for the full readme on how to use this Docker image and for information regarding contributing and issues.

The [full description from Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/) is generated over in [docker-library/docs](https://github.com/docker-library/docs), specifically in [docker-library/docs/mongo](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/mongo).
